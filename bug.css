The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.specialClass div {
  color: red; /* This rule will override the first one due to higher specificity */
}

#specialID div {
  color: green; /* This rule will override the previous ones due to even higher specificity */
}

#specialID div.specialClass {
  color: yellow; /* This rule is the most specific and will override all others */
}
```

The problem might arise when unexpected specificity conflicts occur, making it difficult to track down why a particular style isn't being applied as expected.  This is especially true in large CSS files where selectors can become complex and nested.
