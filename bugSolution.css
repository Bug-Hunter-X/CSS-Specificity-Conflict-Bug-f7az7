The following CSS code addresses the specificity issue by using more specific selectors and clarifies the intended styles:

```css
div {
  color: blue; /* Default color */
}

.specialClass div {
  color: red; /* Applies to divs within elements with class specialClass */
}

#specialID div {
  color: green; /* Applies to divs within the element with ID specialID */
}

#specialID .specialClass {
  color: yellow; /* Applies to elements with class specialClass that are inside an element with ID specialID. This is a more specific and clear way to achieve the result */
}
```

This approach improves readability and reduces ambiguity compared to relying solely on inherent specificity rules.
